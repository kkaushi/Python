<subject>Why are yawns contagious?</subject>
<content>When people yawn, you see that other people in the room yawn, too.  Why is that?</content>
<bestanswer>When your body need more oxygen, you yawn.  &lt;br /&gt;&#xa;When you yawn, you take more oxygen in the air.  &lt;br /&gt;&#xa;If the density of the oxygen in the air becomes lower, other people (their bodies) can feel that and start to yawn to get more oxygen.&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;That's why yawns are contagious. Yawning is extremely contagious -- 55% of people who witness someone yawn will yawn within five minutes. If a visually impaired person hears a tape of someone yawning, he or she is likely to yawn as well. Face it, the likelihood of you making it to the end of this answer without looking like one of these gaping maws is unlikely. &lt;br /&gt;&#xa;Although the contagious nature of yawning is well established, we know less about why this is so. Researchers are currently giving the topic some serious attention. One theory suggests it's a holdover from a period in evolutionary history when yawning served to coordinate the social behavior of a group of animals. A recent study postulates that contagious yawning could be part of the "neural network involved in empathy." &lt;br /&gt;&#xa;&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;While the mystery of contagious yawning has yet to be solved, perhaps researchers are closing in on an answer. On the other hand, given the subject matter, we wouldn't blame them for falling asleep at the wheel. In the meantime, give the "yawn challenge" a try -- it's tougher than it looks.</bestanswer>

<content>What's the best way to heat up a cold hamburger (In &amp; Out)?</content>
<bestanswer>If you must eat a heated In &amp; Out hamburger then I suggest the follow:&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;First, scrape the ketchup, mayo and any other sauce that is on the hamburger and put it a side. Also take the vegetables out.&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;Second, pre-heat a steak pan; put the hamburger separate form the bun on the hot pan&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;Third, heat up both parts of the bun near the hamburger on the same hot pan (you can get some souce from the hamburger on it)&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;Fourth, you can either put back the original ketchup, mayo and the vegetables or, better yet, get new ones from what you have at home .&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;Bon Appetite</bestanswer>

<answer_item>probably a microwave. in norway for example, outside of the main cities, because it's so remote, they have frozen hamburgers in roadside joints, and heat them up per request. &lt;br /&gt;&#xa;&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;as with all microwave heating, it will be a bit soggy...</answer_item>

<subject>Vacation rentals in the Turks and Caicos</subject>
<content>We are considering renting a house in the Turks and Caicos... any recommendations of which islands might be best, and good places to rent from?</content>
<bestanswer>I like Providenciales best. Beautiful beaches are scattered on all sides of Providenciales, the most spectacular of which is a 12 mile stretch located on Grace Bay, which is protected by a healthy barrier reef. Provo has an 18 hole golf course, a casino, shopping centres, three marinas, a growing number of of bars and excellent restaurants. Provo is also a divers' and water lovers' paradise.</bestanswer>

<answer_item>Depends on what type of coffee. Typically espresso uses darker roasted blends which actually have less caffeine. FOr example and Italian roast has less caffeine than french roast. It also depends on how strong the coffee is. Here is some more interesting info which will guide you against latte's&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;http://www.cockeyed.com/inside/coffee/coffee.html&lt;br /&gt;&#xa;And finally, if you order some complex bullshit like a double-tall, half-caff, skim Mochachino with light foam &amp; two ice-cubes, you are 50% more likely to have someone spit in your drink.</answer_item>
